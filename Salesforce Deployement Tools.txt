For LWC component Deployement we can use Salesforce CLI, for Bulk Deployement of complex OmniStudio Components we can use VBT, and for Smaller Omnistudio Components Deployment we can use IDX Workbench.
 
VBT is a command line build tool that handles complext Omnistudio components and its metadata easily. We can use it when we need bulk deployement of OmniStudio componenet from one org to another org. VBT Offers Bulk Deployment, Dependency management, Integration with CI/CD(Jenkins, GitHub etc.), Error Handling. It requires node.js for installation. It can not be used for LWC components deployement.
 
OmniStudio IDX workbench is a UI Based Desktop application used for managing and migration of OmniStudio Component and OmniStudio Metadata. It can be an alternative for VBT. It offers Export of Components, Deployment of components, Deployement Validation, Versions Management, Resolve Dependencies(automatically Identify and include Dependent components during deployment), Support CI/CD, Error Logging, Cross-Org Deployment.
 
Gearset is used for Salesforce DevOps tool used for Metadata Deployment, Version control and Backup Management. It offers Easy Deployement, comparison of metadata between source and target org, CI/CD Integration along with BitBucket, Github, Jenkins.
Gearset requires some Job Specific Configuration dusring the deployement which is done manually. But using VBT configuration can be done easily.
 
Chainset or Copado is also a DevOps Platform used for automated deployements and CI/CD pipelines. It offers Pipeline Management, Change tracking, Git Integration(BitBucket, GitLab, GitHub etc), Testing automation(apex test, UI Test). It doesn't offers directly OOTB support to the Omnistudio Components, Using VBT we can perform complete deployement
 
ANT Migration Tool is a command line utility provided to automate the deployement and retrieval of metadata between orgs. It is built on Apache Ant Framework and uses Salesforce Metadat API to perform Retrieval, deployement, Deletion of meta data components such as Apex classes, LWC, VF Pages, Omnistudio Components etc. It Offers Automated Deployement between two orgs, Bulk meta data Operations, Customization of XML Files, Cross-Org Deployement(sandbox, production or developer org), Integration with CI/CD(Jenkins, Github etc), Scriptable(processes can be scripted for reuse and automation).
Use this for Large-Scale Metadata Deployement, Repeatable Deployments, Partial Metadata Deployments, CI/CD Pipelines, Source control Integration with the help of Version control systems.
 
 
If we have to deploy multiple components like LWCs, Omnistudios etc along with metadata we have three options-
Simplest Option: Use Gearset for its ease of use and all-in-one capabilities (if budget allows).
Budget-Friendly Option: Combine Salesforce CLI (for standard metadata) and IDX Workbench (for OmniStudio components).
Enterprise-Level Option: Use Salesforce CLI + VBT for complex deployments with CI/CD integration.
